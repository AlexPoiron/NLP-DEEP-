# Lab 08
This folder contains the work of the Lab 08 and the theoritical questions with it.

## Description
Here, we will see the notion of annotation about data and how this step of reflexion is quite important. Also, we trained models
to classify if a text is offensive or not and see the wrong-classified.
 
## Architecture
We have 3 files :
- **Lab08**: the notebook
- **Annotation_Guideline** : One-page document that summaries how we have annotated the tweets.
- **Annotations_group** : the Google sheet with annotations.
- **Lab08_Theory_Questions** : Theoretical part
