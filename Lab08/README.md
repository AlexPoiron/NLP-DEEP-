# Lab 08
This folder contains the work of the Lab 08 and the theoritical questions with it.

## Description
Here, we will create a searchable index with a dataset composed of a corpus, queries and qrels. Our aim here is to firstly reduced the corpus to
deal with it later with a model to create embeddings. Moreover, we will see another method called the Apprixmation nearest neighbours.
 
## Architecture
We have 3 files :
- **Lab08**: the notebook
- **Annotation_Guideline** : One-page document that summaries how we have annotated the tweets.
- **Annotations_group** : the Google sheet with annotations.
- **Lab08_Theory_Questions** : Theoretical part
